# Nginx configuration for n8n.local
#
# This file sets up a reverse proxy for the n8n service, handling SSL termination and forwarding requests to the n8n backend container.
#
# - Listens on port 443 (HTTPS) for secure connections
# - Uses SSL certificates for encryption
# - Proxies all requests to the n8n backend service running in Docker
# - Sets headers for proper client IP forwarding and WebSocket support
